Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
=========================

<H1>Course Project</H1>

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.<br>
2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.<br>
3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set<br>
4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.<br>
5) Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.<br>

<H1>Requirements and Functionality</H1>
<br>
This script will automatically download the required file and put it into your working directory.  The script will also create a results folder where all finished documents will be stored.  
<br>
At the result of the script, you will see a few files dropped into the repository.  There will be a Tidy Dataset that is required for the course as a text file, but also the same content in a CSV file for better readability.
