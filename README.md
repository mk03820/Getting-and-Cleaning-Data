Getting-and-Cleaning-Data
=========================

Course Project

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
5) Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Requirements and Functionality

This script will automatically download the required file and put it into your working directory.  The script will also create a results folder where all finished documents will be stored.  

At the result of the script, you will see a few files dropped into the repository.  There will be a Tidy Dataset that is required for the course as a text file, but also the same content in a CSV file for better readability.
